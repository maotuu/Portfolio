        Georgia Tech offers a variety of different study locations all over the campus. With its central location and variety of resources, the Clough Undergraduate Learning Center (CULC) is a popular study destination for students. Due to the importance of the CULC and the close connection that is shared between students and its resources, we decided to understand how students choose to study at this location and the tasks they performed while making a decision.

        In this semester-long project, through exhaustive user research, we found that students often find it difficult to find the desired spot in CULC to study especially during the homework completion process, exams, midterms, the dead week. Therefore, we aim to solve the issues they encountered by designing CULC PAL that helps assist in helping locate spots in the CULC.

        </section>
        <h2>#1. Target User</h2>
        <p>
          To better understand the process a student goes through, it was important to focus on our target user group. The users we researched are students who choose to study in the CULC.

        <h3>Observation (Deep Hanging Out)</h3>
        <P>
          The project began with just a rough idea - to support students who study at CULC. So We started with unobtrusive observation to narrow down to a problem space. In total, three observed activities were conducted on September 28, 2016, in three different periods of a day – morning, afternoon and evening.
        </P>
        <img src="images/cpobservation.png" class="u-full-width img_padding">
        <p>Through the observation, the most important thing we noticed was that many students were roaming through the building and looking for studying spaces with their heavy backpacks or food during certain periods of a day. This led us to question how students look for and decide on a spot to study here and how could we make this process more user-friendly. We further determined our problem domain as “studying space in CULC” and decided to follow our user research by a contextual inquiry.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Contextual Inquiry</h3>
        <p>The strategy of our contextual inquiry was to first observe a student or a group of students completing a task – looking for a space to study. After they completed the task, we would approach them and ask questions.</p><br>
        <p>What we want to learn through contextual inquiry were：What kind of study spaces and facilities do students need? Do they succeed in finding their ideal space? If not, what are the barriers? What problems do students encounter in CULC? How do they solve them?</p><br>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">#3. Data Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
        <p>By affinity mapping, we categorized all the data to help identify the patterns in our findings.</p>
        <img src="images/cpaffinity.jpg" class="u-full-width img_padding">

        <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Hierachy Task Analysis</h3>
        <p>Later, we concluded the characteristics of the task, users’ decision points, desired outcomes and the task environment according to our user research We broke the task down into subtasks, expressing the relationships between the parent task and its subtasks through a numbering scheme.</p>

          <h5>Key Findings</h5>
          <h6>A good number of students are used to studying at CULC. However, Students have difficulty looking for a spot especially at certain periods like weekday evenings, dead week, days before a break. Students have their own process of choosing a studying spot. Some of them just go with the first spot that they see. Some of them will always check their favorite spots and see whether they are taken. Some students would like to study with others so they can discuss problems in the CULC.</h6>

        <h3>Behavioral Persona</h3>
          <p>
          Rather than traditional personas, we built behavioral ones. Because our users are relatively well-defined. We reviewed the data gathered by user research in detail and established five main criteria that users behave differently.

        <h2>#1. Divergence</h2>
        <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the findings of our user research and the design directions driven by them, we moved to the design stage to develop a set of design alternatives. In total, we conducted two rounds of brainstorming to generate ideas that address the problem we found in the user research.<br></br>In the first round of brainstorming, we generated more than 20 ideas to solve different problems students encounter when they study at CULC discovered in user research. Then we sorted them into four groups due to their affinity.</p>

        <h2>#2. Convergence</h2>
        <h3>Design Alternatives</h3>
        <p>
          We proposed three design ideas after narrowing down: a mobile app that addresses overall problems, an installation that presents the activity through a heat map of the building, and a portable hardware that leads users to a spot or their friends.</p>

               <p>1. The CULC installation is a concept that focuses on tracking the movement and activity within the CULC. The idea is that this installation would be located near one of the main entrances of the building. It would be large so multiple people could use it at the same time. In its idle state, the interface is a heat map of the general activity within the building. When you approach the installation and tap the interface once, a personal screen approaches that visualize the five floors of the CULC. If you select any of the floors it visualizes the activity on that floor through heat maps and the layout of the floor. This helps users see what the general activity on that floor. There is also the capabilities of seeing what the overall activity or business of the CULC is and recommends to the user whether they should spend time locating a seat. This feature could sync to the building’s website so users could check online from a remote location to see if they should make the trek to the facility. This tool could be helpful for either studying alone or studying in groups. The idea is fueled by the idea of computer vision.</p>

               <p>2. The idea of mobile APP arose from our user research which revealed that students are often unable to find suitable study environments and sometimes could be bewildered by the number of options open to them. At the meantime, when studying in a group, it may be hard for students to communicate the location in CULC. The reasons for developing a mobile APP include <br></br>● Almost every Georgia Tech student has a mobile phone. An App is accessible for them.<br></br>● According to the user research, students are moving when they look for studying space. An App acts the best as a mobile assistant.<br></br>The core of this idea is that whether a person wants to work alone or in a group, silently or with background noise, in a modern or historic library, this mobile APP will show them matching spaces nearby. Through this APP, students could also locate their group members and reserve a room when they want to study in a group.</p><br>

               <p>3. The CULC Wizard is a ‘Magic’ pen that could lead users to an empty spot, or to their friends. The look of the product is a pen with a single button and a 360 light integrated. When studying in a group, they also consume much time communicating with each other about their location. Instead of presenting detailed information about their options for empty spots, this portable device will simply lead the users to the destination without asking the users to choose from a huge list of options or filters. With simple and straightforward interaction with the pen, users can switch modes between finding spots and friends, and other functions like saving a favorite spot and group members that they would like to study with.</p><br>

        <h3>Final Idea</h3>
        <img src="images/cp_IMG_2740.jpg" class="u-full-width img_padding">
         <p>From an in-class sprint, we received a lot of feedback from our classmates, who are also our target users. Finally, after assessing all the dimensions of all the three solutions, we decided to go further with the heatmap based design. And out target user will interact with the design on kiosks placed in CULC.</p>

          First, we decided the two main features of our kiosk - help students find study spots which meet their requirements quicker and let students reserve instant-approved rooms in CULC. Based on the two functions, I turned our rough sketch introduced before into a user experience flow map.</p>
